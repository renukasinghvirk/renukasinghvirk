## Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm Renuka SINGH VIRK, a *Master's student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with a focus on Telecommunications* at **EPFL**. My work and projects are centered around  *machine learning*, *wireless communication*, *image analysis*, *embedded systems* and *hardware design*. 

### üóÇÔ∏è Previous Projects

- **OFDM Wireless Transmitter and Receiver**  
  Developed a MATLAB-based Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system for wireless communication, focusing on efficient data transmission and reception. [Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/OFDM_system)

- **Microcontroller Assembly Game**  
  Designed and implemented a small game on a microcontroller using assembly language, demonstrating low-level hardware programming and optimization techniques. [Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/MCU_project)

- **Nintendo DS Game: Remple Tun**  
 Developed a side-scrolling adventure game for the Nintendo DS in C, featuring dual-screen gameplay, animated backgrounds, and interactive mechanics. The game was created for the course EE-310 Microprogrammed Embedded Systems at EPFL. [Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/NintendoDS_project)

- **Automated Coin Detection**  
 Conducted a computer vision project for EE-451 for the detection and classification of euro and franc coins, building an automated classification system. [Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/Project_imageanalysis/blob/ca8c9e9af73ab01da491050c1336f810f3ea0128/Group56%20(5).ipynb)
