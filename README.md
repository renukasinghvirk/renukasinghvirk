## Hi there 👋

I’m Renuka SINGH VIRK, a *MSc student in Electrical and Electronic Engineering with a focus on Machine Learning and Signal Processing* at **EPFL**. My work and projects are centered around  *machine learning*, *image & video analysis*, *wireless communication*, *embedded systems* and *hardware design*. 

### 🗂️ Ongoing Projects
- **Ask the Migration Reports: a RAG chatbot** \
  This project realized in the context of the [ELIAS](https://elias-ai.eu/) project (use case 4) implements a RAG chatbot to ask questions around migration in Europe, and receive factual information.  [Repository is coming soon](https://gitlab.idiap.ch/rannapureddy/qa-migration-reports)

- **Convex Optimization Projects** \
  Small projects around convex optimization for the course MGT-418 at EPFL. [Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/convex-optimization/tree/main)
  
### 🗂️ Previous Projects

- **World Values Survey** \

- **Coins, Covers, and Strategies: A Journey Through Game Theory and Linear Programming** \  
  Formulated a zero-sum LP, proved König’s theorem, and implemented a simplex solver delivering strategies that cap losses at 25 coins. [Report]([Coins, Covers, and Strategies: A Journey Through Game
Theory and Linear Programming](https://github.com/yoannLafore/odm_project/blob/main/MGT483_final.pdf))

- **Automated Coin Detection**  
 Conducted a computer vision project for EE-451 for the detection and classification of euro and franc coins, building an automated classification system. [Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/Project_imageanalysis/blob/ca8c9e9af73ab01da491050c1336f810f3ea0128/Group56%20(5).ipynb)

- **Hate Speech Detection**  
  Investigated hate speech detection using natural language processing and deep learning techniques. The project aims to address hate speech handling online in a comical way. [Repository](https://github.com/mehdihajoub/Borderline/tree/main)

- **Predicting Cocaine Use Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Patients**  
  Focused on classification tasks in a clinical psychology setting. Conducted under the supervision of Dr. Lina Dietker at the Laboratory of Experimental Psychopathology and Psychotherapy, University of Zurich. [Repository](https://github.com/CS-433/ml-project-2-roc-stars.git)

- **OFDM Wireless Transmitter and Receiver**  
  Developed a MATLAB-based Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system for wireless communication, focusing on efficient data transmission and reception. [Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/OFDM_system)

- **Microcontroller Assembly Game**  
  Designed and implemented a small game on a microcontroller using assembly language, demonstrating low-level hardware programming and optimization techniques. [Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/MCU_project)

- **Nintendo DS Game: Remple Tun**  
 Developed a side-scrolling adventure game for the Nintendo DS in C, featuring dual-screen gameplay, animated backgrounds, and interactive mechanics. The game was created for the course EE-310 Microprogrammed Embedded Systems at EPFL. [Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/NintendoDS_project)
  
- **VHDL Pong Game**  
  Created a hardware implementation of the classic Pong game using VHDL, showcasing expertise in digital design and FPGA programming. [Repository](https://github.com/ThomasLenges/FractalPong-A-PYNQ-Z2-Game)
