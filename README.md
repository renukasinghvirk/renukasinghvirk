## Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm Renuka SINGH VIRK, a *MSc student in Electrical and Electronic Engineering with a focus on Machine Learning and Signal Processing* at **EPFL**. My work and projects are centered around  *machine learning*, *image & video analysis*, *wireless communication*, *embedded systems* and *hardware design*. 

### üóÇÔ∏è Ongoing Projects
- **Ask the Migration Reports: a RAG chatbot** \
  This project realized in the context of the [ELIAS](https://elias-ai.eu/) project (use case 4) implements a RAG chatbot to ask questions around migration in Europe, and receive factual information.  [Repository](https://gitlab.idiap.ch/rannapureddy/qa-migration-reports)

### üóÇÔ∏è Previous Projects
